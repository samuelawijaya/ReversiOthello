This project is a command-line implementation of **Reversi (Othello)** built in **C**, featuring full game mechanics, a computer AI opponent, and a text-based UI. The board logic is built using 2D arrays, and the computerâ€™s move selection is optimized based on a **max-flip scoring algorithm**.

The player selects a color (Black or White), and the game proceeds turn-by-turn until the board is full or no valid moves remain.
